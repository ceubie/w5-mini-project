I was struggling to get my hamburger menu to work and I found online that I needed to add jquery and popper to my **<script>** tags at the bottom of the page. The fetch function is really cool and simple.
I enjoyed implementing it in the website. Still figuring out some bootstrap things, like when to use certain classes for centering certain content as opposed to other content, that consistently
throws me for a loop, but generally I am able to figure it out by referencing the documentation. I chose **Mewtwo** for my pokemon details page because **Mewtwo** is the ***bestest*** and most ***coolest*** of all of the 
Kanto region pokemond...*obviously*. 

The code is really straightforward and readable, I am not seeing anything that really needs a thorough explanation, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Because of that I decided to use the readme as 
a chance to describe some things I like and struggled with. Thanks for reading and grading my project.
